Suggested Timeline
Week 1: Learn Unity basics, set up the project, and prototype core mechanics.
Week 2: Add progression (scoring, upgrades) and basic UI.
Week 3: Add art, sound, and polish.
Week 4: Test, fix bugs, and finalize the game.

the Scope of Your Game: 
  single player experience : 
  basic mechanics: casting a line ( a zone where user stand a button pop up to cast line, mini pop game), 
   catching fish( the percantage of catching a fish, the more upgraded the gear the more chance to get big fish),
   fish types (small fish, meduim fish, large fish):rare: tuna 2k-10k, common:sardine 200g-2k, rare :shark 500g-15kg, very rare :whale 10kg-100k,very rare: octopus 800g-50kg, 
   upgrading gear ( 3 levels of strenght for starters. shoes (influnce speed of walking), fishing rod(influnce speed of catching fish), fishing hook(chances of fish running away), fishing bait(the size of the fish) )

  achievements: 10 achievments for starters
story: 
   wuffy wakes up in his dream world where all he has to do to survive is fishing. If he dont fish he looses happy piont and character looses coins.

Coding : learn unity
Prototype the Core Mechanics:
  Create a simple scene with a fishing rod and water.
  Write a script to cast the line (use mouse or keyboard input).
  Add collision detection to simulate fish biting.
  Implement a basic scoring system.

Art and Assets:

Create or download simple 2D/3D assets (e.g., fish, water, fishing rod).
Use free assets from the Unity Asset Store or websites like Kenney.nl.

UI:

Add a simple menu, score display, and upgrade shop.

Polish:

Add sound effects (e.g., water splash, reel sound).
Add particle effects (e.g., water splashes).
